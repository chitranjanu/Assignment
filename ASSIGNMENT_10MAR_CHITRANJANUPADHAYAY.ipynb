    "'''  Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters from sample data. In statistical inference, it is often not practical or feasible to collect data from the entire population of interest. Instead, we collect data from a sample of the population, and use that data to make inferences about the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimation involves using a single value, called a point estimate, to estimate the population parameter of interest. For example, if we want to estimate the population mean height, we might use the sample mean height as a point estimate. Point estimates can be calculated for a variety of population parameters, such as the mean, variance, proportion, or median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimation, on the other hand, involves calculating a range of values, called a confidence interval, within which the population parameter of interest is likely to fall. The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the population parameter, along with a level of confidence that the true parameter falls within that range. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height would provide a range of heights within which we are 95% confident that the true population mean falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, interval estimates are preferred over point estimates because they provide a more complete picture of the uncertainty surrounding the population parameter. However, interval estimates are typically more complex to calculate and interpret than point estimates.'''"

    "''' Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to evaluate whether there is enough evidence to reject a hypothesis about a population parameter, based on sample data. It involves setting up two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, and using statistical tests to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no significant difference or effect between two groups or populations, or that a parameter equals a specific value. The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is a significant difference or effect between two groups or populations, or that the parameter does not equal the specific value. By testing the null hypothesis, we can determine whether the sample data provides enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used in a variety of fields, including science, engineering, medicine, and social sciences, to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.
