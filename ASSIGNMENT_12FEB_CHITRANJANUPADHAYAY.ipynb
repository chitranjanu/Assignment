    "\"\"\" In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an Exception is raised, it means that the program has encountered an unexpected condition or situation that it does not know how to handle. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, resource exhaustion, or unexpected conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are different from syntax errors in Python. Syntax errors occur when the code does not conform to the rules of the Python language, such as when there is a misspelling of a keyword, a missing bracket or parentheses, or a variable that has not been defined. These errors occur before the program is executed and prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens, such as a file that cannot be found or a division by zero. Exceptions can be caught and handled in the code using try-except blocks, which allow the program to recover from the Exception and continue executing. Syntax errors, on the other hand, must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed\"\"\""
