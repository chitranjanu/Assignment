    "A filter method is a feature selection technique that ranks features based on a certain metric and then selects the top-ranked features. The metric can be anything that measures the relevance of a feature to the target variable, such as correlation, information gain, or chi-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter methods are typically used as a pre-processing step before training a machine learning model. They can help to improve the performance of the model by reducing the dimensionality of the data and removing irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most common filter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation: This method measures the linear correlation between two variables. It is a simple and easy-to-understand metric, but it can only be used for features that are linearly correlated with the target variable.\n",
    "Information gain: This method measures the amount of information that a feature provides about the target variable. It is a more powerful metric than correlation, but it can be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "Chi-squared: This method is used to test for independence between two variables. It can be used for both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "Filter methods are a simple and effective way to select features for machine learning models. They are particularly useful when the number of features is large or when the features are noisy or redundant.\n",

    "A wrapper method is a feature selection technique that uses a machine learning model to evaluate the usefulness of a subset of features. The model is trained on a subset of features and its performance is measured on a holdout set. The subset of features that produces the best performance is selected.\n",
