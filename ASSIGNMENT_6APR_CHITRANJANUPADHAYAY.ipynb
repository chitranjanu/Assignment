    "The kernel trick is a technique used in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to implicitly map the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space without explicitly calculating the transformed features.

    "In Support Vector Machines (SVMs), support vectors play a crucial role in defining the decision boundary and determining the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. Support vectors are the data points from the training set that lie closest to the decision boundary or margin.\n",

    "The key characteristics of support vectors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors reside on or near the margin: In SVMs, the decision boundary is determined by a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. Support vectors are the data points that lie on or near the margin, and they contribute to defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are critical for generalization: The support vectors are the most informative data points since they are the closest to the decision boundary. They have the largest influence on the final model, and their positions determine the robustness and generalization capabilities of the SVM.\n",

    "Suppose we have a binary classification problem with two classes, represented by blue and red data points in a two-dimensional space. We want to find a decision boundary that separates the two classes accurately.\n",

    "In the example, the decision boundary is represented by the black line, and the dashed lines on either side indicate the margin. The circles and squares represent the support vectors, which are the closest data points to the decision boundary. These support vectors are the critical elements in defining the optimal hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors determine the margin, as they are the data points closest to the decision boundary. If we remove any non-support vector, the margin would decrease. In the example, removing any of the circles or squares would result in a smaller margin and potentially affect the classification accuracy.\n",

    "During the training process of an SVM, the optimization algorithm aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin while correctly classifying the training data. The support vectors, along with their associated Lagrange multipliers, contribute to the formulation of the optimization problem and determine the final solution.\n",
