    "''' The assumptions of ANOVA are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The dependent variable must be normally distributed within each group. This can be checked using a Shapiro-Wilk test or a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n",
    "Homogeneity of variance: The variances of the dependent variable must be equal across all groups. This can be checked using Levene's test or Hartley's test.\n",
    "Independence: The observations must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not affect the value of another observation.\n",
    "Violations of any of these assumptions can impact the validity of the results of an ANOVA. For example, if the dependent variable is not normally distributed, the p-value of the ANOVA test may be inaccurate. If the variances are not equal, the power of the ANOVA test may be reduced. And if the observations are not independent, the ANOVA test may be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results of an ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-normality: If the dependent variable is not normally distributed, the p-value of the ANOVA test may be inaccurate. This can happen if the sample size is small or if there are extreme outliers in the data.\n",
    "Heterogeneity of variance: If the variances of the dependent variable are not equal, the power of the ANOVA test may be reduced. This can happen if the groups have different sample sizes or if the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "Dependence: If the observations are not independent of each other, the ANOVA test may be biased. This can happen if the data is collected over time or if the observations are related in some way.\n",
    "If you suspect that any of the assumptions of ANOVA may be violated, there are a few things you can do to address the issue. First, you can try to transform the data to make it more normally distributed. Second, you can use a non-parametric ANOVA test that does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data. Finally, you can increase the sample size to reduce the impact of any violations of the assumptions.'''"
