    "A probability mass function (PMF) and probability density function (PDF) are both ways of describing the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability mass function (PMF) is a function that maps every possible value of a discrete random variable to its probability of occurrence. In other words, it describes the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a certain value. The PMF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = Pr(X = x)\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, consider the random variable X representing the number that comes up when rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",

    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of all the probabilities in the PMF is always equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a certain value within a certain range. The PDF is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable. The area under the PDF over any interval represents the probability of the random variable taking on a value within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the random variable Y representing the height of people in a population. The PDF of Y might be a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, given by:\n",

    "It's important to note that while the PMF is a probability function, the PDF is not. Rather, the PDF describes the probability density, which is the likelihood of the random variable taking on different values within a certain range.
