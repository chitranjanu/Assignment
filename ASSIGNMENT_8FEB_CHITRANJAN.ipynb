    "\"\"\" Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Although they are related, they serve different purposes and are implemented differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object to the user. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of an object and protecting its state from external access. It allows developers to create a boundary around an object and prevent unauthorized access or modification of its properties. Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers (such as public, private, and protected) and getter/setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are creating a program to represent a bank account. The bank account has properties such as the account number, account balance, and customer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "You can use abstraction to hide the implementation details of the bank account and expose only the essential features to the user. For example, you can create an abstract class called \"Account\" that defines the basic properties and methods that all bank accounts have, such as \"deposit\" and \"withdraw\" methods. Then you can create concrete classes that inherit from the \"Account\" class, such as \"CheckingAccount\" and \"SavingsAccount\", which add specific properties and methods that are unique to each type of account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "You can use encapsulation to protect the state of the bank account and prevent unauthorized access or modification of its properties. For example, you can use the private access modifier to make the account balance property inaccessible from outside the class. Then you can create public methods, such as \"getBalance\" and \"setBalance\", to allow external access to the account balance property, but only through a controlled and secure mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object, while encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of an object and protecting its state from external access.\n",
