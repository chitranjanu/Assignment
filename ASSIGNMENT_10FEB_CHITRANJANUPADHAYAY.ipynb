    "\"\"\"In Python, the built-in open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: \n",
    "the file name (including the file path, if it is not in the same directory as the script)\n",
    "and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "The mode parameter is optional, and if not specified, the default mode is 'r' (read-only mode). Here are the different modes that can be used to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' - Read mode: This mode is used to read data from a file. It is the default mode if no mode is specified. If the file does not exist, an error will occur. Example: file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' - Write mode: This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (i.e. emptied) before writing. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example: file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' - Append mode: This mode is used to append data to a file. If the file already exists, the data will be written at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example: file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' - Exclusive creation mode: This mode is used to create a new file, but it will fail if the file already exists. Example: file = open('example.txt', 'x')\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' - Binary mode: This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images or executables. It can be combined with the other modes by adding 'b' to the mode string. Example: file = open('example.png', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' - Text mode: This mode is used to read or write text data. It is the default mode if 'b' is not specified. Example: file = open('example.txt', 'rt') \"\"\"\n",

    "\"\"\"In Python, the close() function is used to close a file object that was opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file after you are done working with it, as it releases any system resources used by the file and ensures that any pending data is written to the file.\n",

    "Avoid file corruption: If you don't close a file properly, the file may become corrupted. For example, if you are writing to a file and don't close it, the data may not be written to the file completely, leaving the file in a corrupted state.\"\"\"\n",
