    "\n",
    "Positive Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to +1, it suggests a strong positive correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores.

    "Negative Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores.

    "\n",
    "No Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0, it suggests no linear correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores. In other words, the time spent studying does not have a significant impact on the exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the magnitude or absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the correlation. Values closer to 1 (whether positive or negative) indicate a stronger correlation, while values closer to 0 suggest a weaker correlation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient, r, ranges between -1 and +1. Here's how to interpret the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to +1 (ranging from 0.7 to 1), it indicates a strong positive correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the exam scores tend to increase as well. For example, if the correlation coefficient is 0.8, it suggests a strong positive relationship between studying time and exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to -1 (ranging from -0.7 to -1), it indicates a strong negative correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores. This implies that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the exam scores tend to decrease. For instance, if the correlation coefficient is -0.6, it suggests a strong negative relationship between studying time and exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Correlation: If the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0 (ranging from -0.3 to 0.3), it suggests no significant linear correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the final exam scores. In other words, the time spent studying does not have a noticeable impact on the exam scores. For example, if the correlation coefficient is 0.1, it suggests a weak or negligible relationship between studying time and exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures only linear relationships and may not capture non-linear relationships between variables. Additionally, correlation does not imply causation, meaning that a strong correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the changes in the other. Therefore, further analysis and consideration of other factors are recommended to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between studying time and exam scores."
