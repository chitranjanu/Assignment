    "Semi-supervised learning lies between supervised and unsupervised learning. In this approach, the training data includes both labeled and unlabeled examples. The availability of a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data is leveraged to improve the learning process. The goal is to use the labeled data to guide the learning process and make use of the additional unlabeled data to uncover underlying patterns or improve the model's performance. Semi-supervised learning can be particularly useful when obtaining labeled data is costly or time-consuming.\n",

    "In machine learning, the train-test-validation split refers to the division of a dataset into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation purposes. Here's an explanation of each term and their importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set:\n",
    "The training set is a subset of the dataset used to train a machine learning model. It contains labeled examples where both input features and corresponding output labels are provided. The model learns from these examples and adjusts its parameters or weights to minimize the error or loss between predicted and actual outputs. The larger the training set, the more data the model has to learn from, potentially leading to better generalization and performance.\n",
    "Importance: The training set is crucial for model learning and parameter estimation. It provides the foundation for the model to learn patterns and relationships in the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set:\n",
    "The test set is a separate subset of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance and generalization ability of a trained machine learning model. It contains examples with known input features but without the corresponding output labels. The model applies its learned parameters to predict the output labels, which are then compared against the true labels to assess the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.\n",
    "Importance: The test set serves as an independent evaluation measure for the model's performance on unseen data. It helps to estimate how well the trained model can generalize to new, unseen examples and provides an indication of its effectiveness and potential limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set:\n",
    "The validation set is an optional subset of the dataset that is used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It is similar to the test set in terms of its characteristics, but it is used during the training process rather than after model training. The validation set helps to assess different models or variations of the same model with different hyperparameters. By evaluating their performance on the validation set, the best-performing model can be selected for final testing on the independent test set.\n",
    "Importance: The validation set enables fine-tuning of the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization, or network architecture. It helps to prevent overfitting by guiding the selection of the best model and hyperparameters based on their performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of these splits lies in evaluating a machine learning model's performance on unseen data and ensuring its ability to generalize well beyond the training data. The train-test-validation split allows for model training, evaluation, and selection, ultimately leading to the development of robust and reliable machine learning models."

    "c. Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks that can learn efficient data representations. They are trained to reconstruct the input data and can identify anomalies based on high reconstruction errors for certain instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. One-Class SVM: One-Class Support Vector Machines learn a boundary around the normal instances and classify instances outside that boundary as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "After training the unsupervised learning algorithm, apply it to new, unseen data instances. The algorithm will assign anomaly scores or labels to the instances based on their deviation from normal patterns or structures learned during training. Instances with high anomaly scores or classified as anomalies can be flagged for further investigation.\n",

    "It's important to note that unsupervised learning for anomaly detection is based on the assumption that anomalies are rare and significantly different from normal instances. However, it may not provide detailed information about the nature or specific type of anomaly. Careful interpretation and validation of the detected anomalies are necessary.\n",
